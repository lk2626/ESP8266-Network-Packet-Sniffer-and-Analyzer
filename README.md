This project demonstrates the ESP8266 microcontroller's capability as a network packet sniffer and analyzer. It captures Wi-Fi packets in promiscuous mode, analyzes them to identify devices in the local network, and logs the packet metadata to a web server. This project highlights skills in networking protocols, packet analysis, and IoT device programming, providing a lightweight and cost-effective solution for basic network monitoring.
